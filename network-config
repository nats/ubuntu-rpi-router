# In my testing, eth1 struggles to hit line-rate on TX (lack of hardware offload?)
# but is fine on RX; while eth0 being the onboard NIC is fine for both.
# Since NBN is at best 1000/50 , we put NBN on eth1 where the not-quite-linerate TX
# will have no impact since we cannot TX at higher than 50 anyway.
# NOTE: viewed from the back, eth1 is on left and eth0 on right
